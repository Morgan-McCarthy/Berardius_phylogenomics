To run the hPSMC analysis

1) The first step is to call a consensus genome from the mapped BAM file

#This is a loop that iterates through a directory with the BAM files of interest and creates a consensus sequence.
module load angsd
for file in *.bam
do
ID=`echo ${file} | cut -f1 -d "_"`
echo ${ID}
angsd -i ${file} -nThreads 28 -doFasta 2 -minQ 25 -minmapq 25 -uniqueonly 1 -remove_bads 1 -setMinDepthInd 5 -doCounts 1 -out 
${ID}_aligned_sorted_unique 
done
